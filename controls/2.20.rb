  title 'Ensure access to AWSCloudShellFullAccess is restricted'
  desc  "
    AWS CloudShell is a convenient way of running CLI commands against AWS services. The managed IAM policy `AWSCloudShellFullAccess` provides full access to CloudShell, including file upload and download capability between a user's local system and the CloudShell environment. Within the CloudShell environment, a user has sudo permissions and can access the internet. It is therefore possible to install software and transfer data to external systems.

    Access to this policy should be restricted, as it presents a potential channel for data exfiltration by privileged users. AWS documentation provides guidance on creating more restrictive policies that limit file transfer capabilities.
