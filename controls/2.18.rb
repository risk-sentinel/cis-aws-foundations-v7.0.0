  desc  "
    Enable IAM External Access Analyzer for all resources in each active AWS region.

    IAM Access Analyzer is a service that analyzes resource policies to identify resources that can be accessed from outside the account. After the analyzer is enabled, scan results are displayed in the console showing accessible resources. These results help determine whether unintended access is permitted, making it easier for administrators to monitor least privilege access. Access Analyzer analyzes only policies applied to resources within the same AWS region.

    IAM External Access Analyzer helps identify resources in your account or organization that are shared with external entities. This allows detection of unintended access to resources and data. It continuously monitors policies for services such as S3 buckets, IAM roles, KMS keys, Lambda functions, and SQS queues.

    From Console:

    1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam
    2. Under `Access analyzer` choose `Analyzer Settings`
    3. On the `Analyzer Settings` page, review the list of analyzers
    4. Identify analyzers where the `Finding type` is `External Access`
    5. Repeat these steps for each active region, as analyzers are region-specific

    From Command Line:

    1. Run the following command:
    ```
    aws accessanalyzer list-analyzers --type --region | grep status
    ```
    2. Ensure that at least one Analyzer's `status` is set to `ACTIVE`

    3. To check all regions:
    ```
    for r in $(aws ec2 describe-regions --query \"Regions[].RegionName\" --output text); do
      echo \"=== $r ===\"
      aws accessanalyzer list-analyzers --region \"$r\" --type ACCOUNT --query \"analyzers[].status\" --output text
    done
    ```
    4. Ensure each region returns at least one `ACTIVE` analyzer

    From Console:

    Perform the following to enable IAM Access Analyzer for IAM policies:

    1. Open the IAM console at `https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/`
    2. Choose `Access analyzer`
    3. Select `Create analyzer`
    4. Select `External access` analyzer
    5. Confirm the region
    6. Optionally provide a name and tags
    7. Select `Create analyzer`
    8. Repeat for each active region

    From Command Line:

    1. Create an analyzer in a region:
    ```
    aws accessanalyzer list-analyzers --type --region | grep status
    ```
    2. Repeat for each region as required
