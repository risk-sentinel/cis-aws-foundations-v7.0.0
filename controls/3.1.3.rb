    Amazon S3 buckets can contain sensitive data that, for security purposes, should be discovered, monitored, classified, and protected. Macie, along with other third-party tools, can automatically provide an inventory of Amazon S3 buckets.

    Using a cloud service or third-party software to continuously monitor and automate the process of data discovery and classification for S3 buckets through machine learning and pattern matching is a strong defense in protecting that information.

    Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data in AWS.

    Perform the following steps to determine if Macie is running:

    From Console:

    1. Login to the Macie console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/macie/.

    2. In the left hand pane, click on `By job` under findings.

    3. Confirm that you have a job set up for your S3 buckets.

    When you log into the Macie console, if you are not taken to the summary page and do not have a job set up and running, then refer to the remediation procedure below.

    If you are using a third-party tool to manage and protect your S3 data, you meet this recommendation.

    Perform the steps below to enable and configure Amazon Macie:

    From Console:

    1. Log on to the Macie console at `https://console.aws.amazon.com/macie/`.

    2. Click `Get started`.

    3. Click `Enable Macie`.

    Set up a repository for sensitive data discovery results:

    1. In the left pane, under Settings, click `Discovery results`.

    2. Make sure `Create bucket` is selected.

    3. Create a bucket and enter a name for it. The name must be unique across all S3 buckets, and it must start with a lowercase letter or a number.

    4. Click `Advanced`.

    5. For block all public access, make sure `Yes` is selected.

    6. For KMS encryption, specify the AWS KMS key that you want to use to encrypt the results. The key must be a symmetric customer master key (CMK) that is in the same region as the S3 bucket.

    7. Click `Save`.

    Create a job to discover sensitive data:

    1. In the left pane, click `S3 buckets`. Macie displays a list of all the S3 buckets for your account.

    2. Check the box for each bucket that you want Macie to analyze as part of the job.

    3. Click `Create job`.

    4. Click `Quick create`.

    5. For the Name and Description step, enter a name and, optionally, a description of the job.

    6. Click `Next`.

    7. For the Review and create step, click `Submit`.

    Review your findings:

    1. In the left pane, click `Findings`.

    2. To view the details of a specific finding, choose any field other than the check box for the finding.

    If you are using a third-party tool to manage and protect your S3 data, follow the vendor documentation for implementing and configuring that tool.
