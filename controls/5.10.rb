    Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs or an external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) environment, and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. 

    Security groups are stateful packet filters that control ingress and egress traffic within a VPC.

    It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established to detect changes to security groups.

    CloudWatch is an AWS native service that allows you to observe and monitor resources and applications. CloudTrail logs can also be sent to an external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) environment for monitoring and alerting.

    Monitoring changes to security groups will help ensure that resources and services are not unintentionally exposed.

    If you are using CloudTrail trails and CloudWatch, perform the following to ensure that there is at least one active multi-region CloudTrail trail with the prescribed metric filters and alarms configured:

    1. Identify the log group name that is configured for use with the active multi-region CloudTrail trail:

    - List all CloudTrail trails: `aws cloudtrail describe-trails`

    - Identify multi-region CloudTrail trails: `Trails with \"IsMultiRegionTrail\" set to true`

    - Note the value associated with \"Name\":` `

    - Note the ` ` within the value associated with \"CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn\"

      - Example: `arn:aws:logs: : :log-group: :*`

    - Ensure the identified multi-region CloudTrail trail is active:

      - `aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name `

        - Ensure `IsLogging` is set to `TRUE`

    - Ensure the identified multi-region CloudTrail trail captures all management events:

      - `aws cloudtrail get-event-selectors --trail-name `

        - Ensure there is at least one `event selector` for a trail with `IncludeManagementEvents` set to `true` and `ReadWriteType` set to `All`

    2. Get a list of all associated metric filters for the ` ` captured in step 1:

        ```
        aws logs describe-metric-filters --log-group-name ```

    3. Ensure the output from the above command contains the following:

        ```
        \"filterPattern\": \"{ ($.eventName = AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress) || ($.eventName = AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress) || ($.eventName = RevokeSecurityGroupIngress) || ($.eventName = RevokeSecurityGroupEgress) || ($.eventName = CreateSecurityGroup) || ($.eventName = DeleteSecurityGroup) || ($.eventName = ModifySecurityGroupRules) }\"
        ```

    4. Note the ` ` value associated with the `filterPattern` from step 3.

    5. Get a list of CloudWatch alarms, and filter on the ` ` captured in step 4:

        ```
        aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --query \"MetricAlarms[?MetricName== ]\"
        ```

    6. Note the `AlarmActions` value; this will provide the SNS topic ARN value.

    7. Ensure there is at least one active subscriber to the SNS topic:

        ```
        aws sns list-subscriptions-by-topic --topic-arn ```

    - At least one subscription should have \"SubscriptionArn\" with a valid AWS ARN.

      - Example of valid \"SubscriptionArn\": `arn:aws:sns: : : : `
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    If you are using CloudTrail trails and CloudWatch, perform the following steps to set up the metric filter, alarm, SNS topic, and subscription:

    1. Create a metric filter based on the provided filter pattern that checks for security groups changes and uses the ` ` taken from audit step 1:

        ```
        aws logs put-metric-filter --log-group-name --filter-name --metric-transformations metricName= ,metricNamespace=\"CISBenchmark\",metricValue=1 --filter-pattern \"{ ($.eventName = AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress) || ($.eventName = AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress) || ($.eventName = RevokeSecurityGroupIngress) || ($.eventName = RevokeSecurityGroupEgress) || ($.eventName = CreateSecurityGroup) || ($.eventName = DeleteSecurityGroup) || ($.eventName = ModifySecurityGroupRules) }\"
        ```

        Note: You can choose your own `metricName` and `metricNamespace` strings. Using the same `metricNamespace` for all Foundations Benchmark metrics will group them together.

    2. Create an SNS topic that the alarm will notify:

        ```
        aws sns create-topic --name ```

        Note: You can execute this command once and then reuse the same topic for all monitoring alarms.

        Note: Capture the `TopicArn` that is displayed when creating the SNS topic in step 2.

    3. Create an SNS subscription for the topic created in step 2:

        ```
        aws sns subscribe --topic-arn --protocol --notification-endpoint ```

        Note: You can execute this command once and then reuse the same subscription for all monitoring alarms.

    4. Create an alarm that is associated with the CloudWatch Logs metric filter created in step 1 and the SNS topic created in step 2:

        ```
        aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name --metric-name --statistic Sum --period 300 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --evaluation-periods 1 --namespace \"CISBenchmark\" --alarm-actions ```
