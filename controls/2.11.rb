  title 'Ensure credentials unused for 45 days or more are disabled'
  desc  "
    AWS IAM users can access AWS resources using different types of credentials, such as passwords or access keys. It is recommended that all credentials that have been unused for 45 days or more be deactivated or removed.

    Disabling or removing unused credentials reduces the window of opportunity for credentials associated with a compromised or abandoned account to be used.

    7. If credentials have not been used within 45 days, refer to remediation


    From Command Line:

    Remove Access Key:

    aws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | base64 -d
    ```
    2. Review the following fields:
    - password_last_used
    - access_key_1_last_used_date
    - access_key_2_last_used_date

    3. Identify any credentials unused for 45 days or more
