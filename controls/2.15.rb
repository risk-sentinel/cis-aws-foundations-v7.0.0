  title 'Ensure a support role has been created to manage incidents with AWS Support'
  desc  "
    AWS provides a Support Center that can be used for incident notification and response, as well as technical support and customer service. Create an IAM role with the appropriate policy assigned to allow authorized users to manage incidents with AWS Support.

    Following the principle of least privilege, an IAM role should be used with a scoped policy to allow access to AWS Support. This ensures only authorized users can manage support cases without requiring broad administrative access.
