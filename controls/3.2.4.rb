  title 'Ensure Multi-AZ deployments are used for enhanced availability in Amazon RDS'
  desc  "
    Amazon RDS offers Multi-AZ deployments that provide enhanced availability and durability for your databases, using synchronous replication to replicate data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In the event of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS automatically fails over to the standby to minimize downtime and ensure business continuity.

    Database availability is crucial for maintaining service uptime, particularly for applications that are critical to the business. Implementing Multi-AZ deployments with Amazon RDS ensures that your databases are protected against unplanned outages due to hardware failures, network issues, or other disruptions. This configuration enhances both the availability and durability of your database, making it a highly recommended practice for production environments.

    From Console:

    1. Login to the AWS Management Console and open the RDS dashboard at [AWS RDS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/).
    2. In the navigation pane, under `Databases`, select the RDS instance you want to examine.
    3. Click the `Instance Name` to see details, then navigate to the `Configuration` tab.
    4. Under the `Availability` section, check the `Multi-AZ` status.
       - If Multi-AZ deployment is enabled, it will display `Yes`.
       - If it is disabled, the status will display `No`.
    5. Repeat steps 2-4 to verify the Multi-AZ status of other RDS instances in the same region.
    6. Change the region from the top of the navigation bar and repeat the audit for other regions.

    From Command Line:

    1. Run the following command to list all RDS instances in the selected AWS region:
       ```
       aws rds describe-db-instances --region --query 'DBInstances[*].DBInstanceIdentifier'
       ```
    2. Run the following command using the instance identifier returned earlier to check the Multi-AZ status:
       ```
       aws rds describe-db-instances --region --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,MultiAZ]' --output table
       ```
       - If the output is `True`, Multi-AZ is enabled.
       - If the output is `False`, Multi-AZ is not enabled.
    3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to audit each RDS instance, and change regions to verify in other regions.

  desc  'fix', "
    From Console:

    1. Login to the AWS Management Console and open the RDS dashboard at [AWS RDS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/).
    2. In the left navigation pane, click on `Databases`.
    3. Select the database instance that needs Multi-AZ deployment to be enabled.
    4. Click the `Modify` button at the top right.
    5. Scroll down to the `Availability & Durability` section.
    6. Under `Multi-AZ deployment`, select `Yes` to enable.
    7. Review the changes and click `Continue`.
    8. On the `Review` page, choose `Apply immediately` to make the change without waiting for the next maintenance window, or `Apply during the next scheduled maintenance window`.
    9. Click `Modify DB Instance` to apply the changes.

    From Command Line:

    1. Run the following command to modify the RDS instance and enable Multi-AZ:
       ```
       aws rds modify-db-instance --region --db-instance-identifier --multi-az --apply-immediately
       ```
    2. Confirm that the Multi-AZ deployment is enabled by running the following command:
       ```
       aws rds describe-db-instances --region --db-instance-identifier --query 'DBInstances[*].MultiAZ'
       ```
       - The output should return `True`, indicating that Multi-AZ is enabled.

    3. Repeat the procedure for other instances as necessary.
