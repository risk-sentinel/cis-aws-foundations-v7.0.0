  title 'Maintain current AWS account contact details'
  desc  "
    Ensure contact email and telephone details for AWS accounts are current and mapped to more than one individual in your organization.

    An AWS account supports a number of contact details, and AWS will use these to contact the account owner if activity judged to be in breach of the Acceptable Use Policy or indicative of a likely security compromise is observed by the AWS Abuse team. Contact details should not be associated with a single individual, as circumstances may arise where that individual is unavailable. Email contact details should point to a mail alias that forwards messages to multiple individuals within the organization; where feasible, phone contact details should point to a PABX hunt group or other call-forwarding system. In AWS Organizations environments, this applies to all member accounts, not just the management account.

    If an AWS account is observed to be behaving in a prohibited or suspicious manner, AWS will attempt to contact the account owner by email and phone using the listed contact details. If this is unsuccessful and the account behavior requires urgent mitigation, proactive measures may be taken, including throttling traffic between the account exhibiting suspicious behavior and AWS API endpoints or the Internet. This may result in impaired service to and from the affected account. Therefore, it is in both the customer's and AWS's best interests to ensure that prompt contact can be established. This is best achieved by configuring AWS account contact details to point to resources that reach multiple individuals, such as email aliases and PABX hunt groups.
