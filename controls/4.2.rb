    CloudTrail log file validation creates a digitally signed digest file containing a hash of each log that CloudTrail writes to S3. These digest files can be used to determine whether a log file was changed, deleted, or remained unchanged after CloudTrail delivered the log. It is recommended that file validation be enabled for all CloudTrails.

    Enabling log file validation will provide additional integrity checks for CloudTrail logs.

    2. Click on `Trails` in the left navigation pane.
    3. For every trail:
    - Click on a trail via the link in the `Name` column.
    - Under the `General details`  section, ensure `Log file validation` is set to `Enabled`.

    From Command Line:

    List all trails:
    ```
    aws cloudtrail describe-trails
    ```
    Ensure `LogFileValidationEnabled` is set to `true` for each trail.

    Perform the following to enable log file validation on a given trail:

    From Console:

    1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail).
    2. Click on `Trails` in the left navigation pane.
    3. Click on the target trail.
    4. Within the `General details` section, click `edit`.
    5. Under `Advanced settings`, check the `enable` box under `Log file validation`.
    6. Click `Save changes`. 

    From Command Line:

    Enable log file validation on a trail:

    ```
    aws cloudtrail update-trail --name --enable-log-file-validation
    ```

    Note that periodic validation of logs using these digests can be carried out by running the following command:

    ```
    aws cloudtrail validate-logs --trail-arn --start-time --end-time ```
