  title 'Ensure access keys are rotated every 90 days or less'
  desc  "
    Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests to AWS. IAM users require access keys to make programmatic calls via the AWS CLI, SDKs, or APIs. It is recommended that all access keys be rotated regularly and at least every 90 days.

    Rotating access keys reduces the window of opportunity for a compromised or exposed key to be used. Regular rotation also limits the risk associated with lost, stolen, or improperly stored credentials.

  desc  'check', "
    Perform the following to determine if access keys are rotated as prescribed:

    From Console:

    1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam
    2. Click on `Users`
    3. For each user, go to `Security Credentials`
    4. Review each key under `Access Keys`
    5. For each key with `Status = Active`, ensure the `Created` date is within `90 days`

    From Command Line:

    1. Run the following commands:

    ```
    aws iam generate-credential-report
    aws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | base64 -d
    ```

    2. Review the following fields:
    - access_key_1_last_rotated
    - access_key_2_last_rotated

    3. Ensure all active keys have been rotated within `90 days`
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Perform the following to rotate access keys:

    From Console:

    1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam)
    2. Click on `Users`
    3. Select the user
    4. Navigate to `Security credentials`

    Rotate Access Keys:

    5. Click `Create access` key
    6. Update all applications and tools to use the new access key
    7. After confirming successful use of the new key:
    - Deactivate the old key
    - Delete the old key when no longer needed

    From Command Line:

    1. Create a new access key:
    ```
    aws iam create-access-key --user-name ```
    2. Update all applications and tools to use the new access key
    3. Check usage of the old key:
    ```
    aws iam get-access-key-last-used --access-key-id ```
    4. Deactivate the old key:
    ```
    aws iam update-access-key --access-key-id --status Inactive --user-name ```
    5. After confirming no usage, delete the old key:
    ```
    aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id --user-name ```
