  title 'Ensure IAM users receive permissions only through groups'
  desc  "
    IAM users are granted access to services, functions, and data through IAM policies. There are four ways to assign policies to a user:

    1. Attach an inline (user) policy directly to the user
    2. Attach a managed policy directly to the user
    3. Add the user to an IAM group with attached policies
    4. Add the user to an IAM group with inline policies

    Only assigning permissions through IAM groups is recommended.

    Assigning IAM policies through groups centralizes permissions management and aligns access with organizational roles. This reduces complexity and lowers the likelihood of excessive or inconsistent permissions.

    Perform the following to determine if policies are directly attached to users:

    1. Run the following command to list all IAM users:
    ```
    aws iam list-users --query 'Users[*].UserName' --output text 
    ```
    2. For each user returned, run:
    ```
    aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name aws iam list-user-policies --user-name ```
    3. If any policies are returned, the user has either:

    - A directly attached managed policy, or
    - An inline policy
