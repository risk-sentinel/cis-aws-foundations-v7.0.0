# Pure-Ruby parser for AWS resource-based policy documents. No SDK
# calls. Used by `aws_resource_policy_violations` (CIS 2.21) to walk the
# six service families' policy strings statement-by-statement and decide
# whether each statement grants unrestricted access via Principal: "*".
#
# Why a separate file: the parser has no AWS dependency, has no state,
# and is reusable by any future control that needs the same wildcard-
# principal heuristic (e.g., follow-ups for Access Analyzer findings).
# Keeping it free of @aws makes it trivial to unit-test and easy to
# extend with sharper Condition heuristics later.
#
# Coarse condition heuristic (per #72 acceptance criteria): a statement
# with a wildcard principal AND any non-empty Condition block is
# accepted. We do not (yet) judge whether the supplied Condition keys
# actually narrow access — that is intentionally tracked as a follow-up
# in the issue body's Out-of-scope section. Sharper heuristics would
# need to know which keys narrow access for which service (e.g.,
# aws:SourceVpc is meaningful for some services and ignored by others).
#
# Wildcard shapes covered: "*", { "AWS" => "*" }, { "Service" => "*" },
# { "Federated" => "*" }, { "CanonicalUser" => "*" }, plus arrays
# containing "*" in any of those slots.
#
# Depends on `_aws_backend_bootstrap.rb` having loaded first only for
# load-order parity with sibling files; this file does not actually
# require aws_backend.
