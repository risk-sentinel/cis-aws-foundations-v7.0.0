# Account-wide scanner for CIS 6.8 — VPC Endpoints used for AWS service
# access. Asserts that every active VPC has an Available endpoint for
# each service in the consumer-supplied required_endpoints list.
#
# Depends on `_aws_backend_bootstrap.rb` having loaded first.
#
# Why this exists: vendored aws_vpc_endpoints exposes service_name,
# vpc_id, state via FilterTable but cannot express "for every VPC, the
# set of required services is a subset of the per-VPC available
# service_names" — the join is across two enumerations.
#
# Service names are full AWS-service-name strings, e.g.
# 'com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3'. Consumer scopes by region by listing the
# region-qualified names. State must be 'Available' (Pending /
# Deleting / Failed are not accepted as coverage).
#
# Context: docs/dev/Vendored_Resource_Gaps.md.
